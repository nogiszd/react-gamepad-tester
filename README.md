# react-gamepad-tester

My first project made in React, made in order to practice skills.
It relies on [react-gamepads](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/react-gamepads) library, using hook method.

## Usage

To run this application type **`npm start`** in terminal.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

If you want to build deployable version you can type **`npm run build`**.
Next step is to host files from `build` folder (or you can fork it and host directly on for e.g. on [Netlify](https://netlify.app/))
