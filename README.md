# react-gamepad-tester

My first project made in React, made in order to practice skills. Lately rewritten in TypeScript.

It relies on [react-ts-gamepads](https://github.com/nogiszd/react-ts-gamepads) library, using hook method.

## Live version

You can check it out **[here](https://nogiszd.github.io/react-gamepad-tester)**

## Usage

To run this application type **`npm start`** in terminal.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

If you want to build deployable version you can type **`npm run build`**.

Next step is to host files from `build` folder (or you can fork it and host directly on for e.g. [Netlify](https://netlify.app/))
